# RPi-MySQL

Hello Dear Programmers,

I'm Puiyan, a newbie to github and also python. I'm seeking help for my school project and I hope for your kind favour. Thank you.

My project is using arduino to get sensor data and send to raspberry pi 3 via usb. The data are then need to be save in MySQL and pubsub to Google Cloud or any other IoT platform available.
